# nvim

My NeoVim configuration started as a fork from [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)

## Installation

To install you need to be in the `~/.config/` folder and then run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KikeSenpai/neovim.git nvim
```

## Prerequisites

- [ripgrep][1]: Needed for Telescope Fuzzy Finder.
- [xclip][2] Needed for system clipboard support.
- [npm/node][3] Needed for some LSP servers, plugins and tools. It's recommended to use a Node version manager to do this, e.g., [nvm][4].
- Golang (Also needed to install some LSP servers).
