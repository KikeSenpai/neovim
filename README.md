# nvim
My NeoVim configuration started as a fork from [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)

## Modifications
- Changed colorscheme to solarized dark (my favorite theme since always).
- Modularized plugin configurations in separate files.
- Added indent-blankline configuration to have multiple colors.
- Added easymotion like plugin (hop).
