INTRODUCTION                                             *kickstart.nvim*

Kickstart.nvim is a project to help you get started on your neovim journey.

                                                         *kickstart-is-not*
It is not:
- Complete framework for every plugin under the sun
- Place to add every plugin that could ever be useful

                                                         *kickstart-is*
It is:
- Somewhere that has a good start for the most common "IDE" type features:
    - autocompletion
    - goto-definition
    - find references
    - fuzzy finding
    - and hinting at what more can be done :)
- A place to _kickstart_ your journey.
    - You should fork this project and use/modify it so that it matches your
      style and preferences. If you don't want to do that, there are probably
      other projects that would fit much better for you (and that's great!)!

PLUGINS                                                  *kickstart-plugins*

This config uses `lazy.nvim` to manage plugins.

See `:help lazy.nvim.txt` or https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim for more info.

To check the current status of your plugins, run `:Lazy`.
You can press `?` in this menu for help.
To update plugins, you can run `:Lazy update`.

For additional information on how to structure your plugins, see
`:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`.

                                                         *kickstart-plugins-loading*
Plugins can also be configured to run lua code when they are loaded.

This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.

For example, we can use: `event = 'VimEnter'` to load a plugin before all the
UI elements are loaded.
Events can be normal autocommands events, see `:help autocmd-events`.

                                                         *kickstart-plugins-dependencies*
Plugins can specify dependencies.

The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well, so anything
you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
Use the 'dependencies' key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin.

LSP                                                      *kickstart-lsp*

To check the current status of installed tools and/or manually install other
tools, you can run `:Mason` and then press `g?` for help within this menu.

=============================================================================
CHECKHEALTH                                              *kickstart.checkhealth*

To check the health of your neovim installation, run `:checkhealth`
